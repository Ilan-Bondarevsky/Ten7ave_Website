            Ten7ave is a platform with a mission of bringing the Israeli narrative to the world through gamification. We believe that telling stories can bring people together, and Ten7ave is a platform that will tell the Israeli story to the world through games. 
            Ten7ave designs games that strive to engage the student from Berkley with the story of the grandmother from Kfar Gaza through non-profit games.<br/><br/>
            Following the events of October 7, 2023, there was an increase in manifestations of anti-Semitism and justifications for the attacks carried out by Hamas. It seems that cheers for the attacks were also heard from among non-Palestinians and from a Western audience in particular. 
            The problem we strive to solve is the Western individual's lack of identification and empathy with the Israeli individual and with his day-to-day experience.<br/><br/>
            In the midst of all the war in the Gaza strip we can see that there’s another war going on that is not least important – the war for Israel legitimacy. This war is taking place on social media, television and politic, but we believe that the change begins with the common man, the smallest of all, and that we strive to do.<br/><br/>
            By taking everyday stories and converting them into different forms of games, from an Israeli perspective we wish to educate and let the people of the world see Israel.
